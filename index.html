   			<h3>Profile</h3>
   			<p>I bring extensive experience across Data Engineering, Analytics, and Applied Data Science, with a strong track record of designing, building, and operating production-grade data and machine learning systems end to end.

My expertise spans the full lifecycle of ML and analytics platforms—from architecting scalable data pipelines using modern Big Data and orchestration frameworks (including Hadoop and Airflow), to developing, deploying, and maintaining robust ML applications in cloud-native environments. I have led the design of automated, reproducible ML pipelines leveraging AWS services, infrastructure-as-code (Terraform), and serverless components, while optimizing large-scale model training through multi-GPU architectures.

I possess deep proficiency in advanced analytics and data visualization, delivering decision-ready insights through tools such as Power BI and Tableau, and applying rigorous statistical techniques—including dimensionality reduction and principal component analysis—to uncover meaningful patterns and performance drivers.

In the applied ML and NLP domain, I have built and deployed sophisticated models for text summarization, named entity recognition, topic modeling, and recommendation systems, translating complex algorithms into reliable, scalable production solutions. My systems are engineered for maintainability and scale, using containerization and orchestration technologies such as Docker and Kubernetes.

Across my work, I operate with strong technical ownership, architectural judgment, and a product-focused mindset—consistently aligning data platforms and ML solutions with real business objectives, performance constraints, and long-term scalability.</p>

The project utilizes data from the Wyscout platform, which provides detailed data on player actions during matches. The project includes several steps, starting with data collection and preprocessing, followed by feature engineering and model training. The models used in this project include a player embedding model and a player performance model.
<br>
The main objective of this project is to provide insights into a player's skills and performance over time. The project includes several visualizations, such as skills radar charts, actions heatmaps, xG evaluations, and player embeddings. The project also provides recommendations for similar players based on player embeddings.
<br>
The project is built using Python and libraries including NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Plotly, and Streamlit. The code is organized into several modules, including data.py, features.py, models.py, and plot.py. The project also includes a user interface built using the Streamlit library, which allows users to explore player performance and skills data interactively.

		            <p class="desc">Developed a CNN model for classifying various types of Flower images and employed hyperparameter tuning to optimize and evaluate the
model, by trying different activation functions, cost functions, gradient estimation methods, network architectures, and model initializations
				<br> Furthermore, utilized state-of-the-art techniques like AutoEncoders, Variational AutoEncoders, and GANs to generate images
				<br> Improved model’s performance by adjusting the latent size and network architecture (reducing the number of layers) while minimizing the loss
